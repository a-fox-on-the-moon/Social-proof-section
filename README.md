### What I learned

I had some troubles doing this challenge, but someone told me to look up the the picture element and responsive images, which I did.
The same person told me to do the mobile style first because I did the large screen first, which is not always a good practice.

### Continued development

I have to learn how to use the picture element. I have to work a lot on the position relative / absolute.
I have to force myself to do the mobile style first for my next challenge, even though I find it easier to do the large screen style first.
